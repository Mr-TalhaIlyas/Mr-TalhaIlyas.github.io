<i>Using Image-based laser triangulation, this aritcle showes that the usability of cheap sensors available in some areas. Using these results, it can be used for further research related with 3D deep learning and robots.</i>

## Abstract
Recently the demand for 3D sensors is increasing in areas such as robots and 3D deep learning. So we analyzed applicability of laser triangulation, which is easy and simple to use in these fields. The results of the experiment shows that the depth was measured at a maximum error of 2cm from 150cm to 50cm. These results are expected to be available within a certain margin of error, and will be used for future research in 3D deep learning and robotics
