<i>Examples of generated continuous wavelet transformed EEG data for all 4 motor imagery 
tasks in the BCI Competition IV, Data sets 2a. Each column corresponds to a different EEG channel.
A comparison between real input data and generated data shows that the proposed Wasserstein GAN 
with gradient penalty has learnt features. We note these examples were hand-picked, and that there 
is a wide variety of signal data.</i>

## Abstract

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are shown to be
extremely successful at motor imagery task classification
with high accuracy. However, a major pitfall of deep learning
models is the necessity to train with large datasets.
In this report, we procure artificial EEG data from a limited
dataset using generative models such as the generative
adversarial network (GAN) and variational autoencoder
(VAE). We show approximately 4% improvement in
task classification when using a mixed training set containing
both real and artificial data generated by a GAN. We
fail to train a VAE and discuss possible reasons, as well as
future directions.
