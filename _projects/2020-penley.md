## Summary 
Penley is a smart-pen device that enables the user to transribe handwritten notes into computer-transribed notes in real-time. 
It works soley by tracking the motion of the pen and classifying characters using a deep-learning framework. 
The project was built with the highly myopic intent of rapid completion for the 36-hour hackathon. Currently, the device is only capable of recognizing a few digits 
with mildly decent accuracy. We hope this project will inspire others to build similar smart-pen devices that can recognize a variety of characters with a more
elegant and robust user-interface. Penley won 2nd place.
