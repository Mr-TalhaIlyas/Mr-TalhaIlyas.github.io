## Abstract 
Facial feature detection (FFD) is an important task used
in a multitude of applications including facial recognition,
animation, expression analysis, and 3D modelling. In this
report, we survey 6 well-established FFD methods: active
shape models, active appearance models, active contour
models (ACM), localized region-based ACM, supervised descent
fitters, and ensemble of regression trees. We utilize the
LFPW and 300-W IBUG facial databases to train our models,
as well as to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze
model performance. Finally, we show an example application
of FFD to the automatic lip reading task using two
deep learning frameworks: a feature-only network and an
end-to-end network.
