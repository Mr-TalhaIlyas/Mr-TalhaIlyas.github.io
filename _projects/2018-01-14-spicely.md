## Summary 
Sugar, spice, and everything nice! Spicely is an automated spice and seasoning dispenser. A web-app lets you choose from an
assortment of spice and seasoning blends, and communicates directly with the dispenser. The dispenser was built using
an Arduino Uno, a couple of servos, cardboard boxes, plastic cups, and a whole lot of heart. The project was built during UCLA's IDEA Hacks 2018, which took place 
over 36 hours on January 12th-14th, 2018, and was ranked in the Top 9 hacks. This was my first ever hackathon!
