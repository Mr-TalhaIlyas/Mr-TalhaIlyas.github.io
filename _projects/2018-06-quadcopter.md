## Summary 
Autonomous drones technology has an extremely promising future in the evolving transportation, retail and
entertainment markets. The project objective was to build a quadcopter drone that uses an Arduino as its main flight controller. 
The quadcopter and flight controller were assembled using off-the-shelf components, including an internal measurement unit (IMU), radio-frequency transmitter 
and reciever, 4 electronic speed controllers and motors, a quadcopter frame and propellers, Li-Ion battery, power distribution board, and Arduino Uno. The 
flight controller software included a digital PID control for auto-leveling the quadcopter. 
This build was largely inspired by electronic hobbyist [Joop Brokking](http://www.brokking.net), whose [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYpHB-LfloI&ab) we often referred to.
