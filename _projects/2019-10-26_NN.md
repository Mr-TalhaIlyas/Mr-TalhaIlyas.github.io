## Abstract 
This Repo creates a Neural Network form scratch using only numpy library. The NN is tested on MNIST-Digits dataset which contains 10 classes for classification. MNIST like a 'hello_world' dataset in machine learning community. This repo also builds the popular optimizers like.
* ADAM
* RMSprop
* Adagrad

Gradient descent with and without momentum term by using only numpy The effect of different activations functions (e.g. sigmoid, ReLu) is also studied in this repo.
This repo takes you through the steps regarding what is happening under the hood of artificial neural networks created by high level libraries like
* Tenforflow
* Keras
* Pytorch
As this repo only uses numpy so it only runs on CPU that's why its considerably slower than the models running on GPUs.
