I have recently completed my master's degree and from [Jeonbuk National University, South-Korea](https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/kor/) and now I am looking forward to pursuing a PhD degree from a reputed institute. My area of interenst is aritficial intellignece, computer vision and deep learning.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant in Robot Vision Lab, JBNU, South-Korea. I am leading ongoing funded project on precision agriculture while forecasting future endeavors. Currently, working on different projects related to smart farming like deploying, and developing state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to solve the problems like crop-weed classification, insects/pests’ infestation and disease detection, crop instance localization, and segmentation for precision agriculture. The aim of such fusion between deep learning and precision agriculture is to support high productivity and profitable horticulture systems along with safe and nutritious food and create a risk free and efficient recoverable environment for the communities.
We are also, working on depth estimation, optical flow for developing autonomous harvesters to increase farm yield and
productivity. I have also done some projects on implementation of ML algorithms on edge devices, autonomous driving systems,
3D object detection, GANs and Stereo Vision.

Aside from research and academia, I like playing MMORPGs, FPSG, Racing games and travelling to new places and enjoy various foods.
